# The-Algorithms-to-Solve-Mathematical-Equations-Bisection-Newton-Gaussian-Elimination-Methods

I did this project for “Numerical Methods Course”. I implemented Bisection, Newton and Gaussian Elimination methods for solving mathematical equations in MATLAB. So, the algorithm was finding the roots of equation when you entered an equation.
